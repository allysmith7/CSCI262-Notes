## Basics
Must include 
```
# include <iostream>
using namespace std;
```
also need `#include string` if working with strings at all.

## Arrays
Arrays don't have a `.length` property, so it needs to be stored in a variable so you can refer to it later.

## Operators
Order of operations is followed, just like in Java.
Similar rules are followed with arithmetic, such as dropping decimals for `int` and more

## Variables
In C++, variables don't need to be instantiated, unlike java.

Ex:

```c++
string x;
string += "foo"
cout << string;
```
This code will actually work, unlike in Java.

## Loops
- for loops have the same structure as in Java, also a for-each loop
- while loops are the same as java, but `break;` will force it to stop, and `continue;` will end an iteration but the loop will continue on the next iteration
